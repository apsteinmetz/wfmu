title: "Rock Deaths 2"

In my last post I explored some very interesting facts about rock musician mortality.  In the interest of space I omitted a couple less interesting observations.  They are still useful beacuse they helped my advance my analytical chops. Specifically, I'll be working with the U.S. census API and gender identification.  Perhaps other "outsider data scientists" might enjoy seeing them.  Consider this the "B-Side" of the single.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(rvest)
library(gender)
library(ggrepel)
library(knitr)

```

We assume most rock musicians are male. How many of the people in this list are women?  We'll try to determine gender by first name.  How?  As always, there is an R package for that.  The `gender` package and the associated `genderdata` data set have, not just a list of gender assignments for first names, but the preponderance of gender for these names going back in time. This recognizes that there is some gender fluidity to names over time. That makes perfect sense, but I hadn't considered it.

It's worth exploring this for a moment. How many unique names are we dealing with?  We'll use one of the data sets, the U.S. Social Security data base.
```{r}
genderdata::ssa_national %>% select(name) %>% unique() %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark=",")
```
And how many of names switch one or more times in predominance?
```{r}
switch_names<-genderdata::ssa_national %>% 
  mutate(gender=ifelse(male<female,"female","male")) %>% 
  select(name,gender) %>% 
  group_by(name,gender) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  spread(gender,count,fill=0) %>% 
  mutate(switch=female*male) %>% 
  filter(switch>0)

switch_names %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark=",")
```
Quite a few.  I should add I don't have much confidence that the `dplyr` chain I used above is an efficient way to get this answer.  You, the experienced R user, might have a better approach.

Remember Ashley Madison, the hookup site for cheaters that was hacked?  It turns out that "Ashley" and "Madison" are both highly fluid in gender assignment.  Was that deliberate?

```{r}
ashley_madison<-genderdata::ssa_national %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("ashley","madison")) %>% 
  mutate(female=female/(male+female),male=1-female) %>% 
  gather("gender","proportion",-name,-year)

ashley_madison %>% filter(gender=="male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,proportion,color=name))+geom_line()+
  labs(title="Fraction of Men with Given Name") +scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)
```
So in 1950, both names were almost certainly male but almost all were female by 1990.

Specifically, what's up with "Madison?"
```{r}
madison_count <- genderdata::ssa_national %>% 
    filter(name=="madison",year>1980,year<1995) %>% 
  select(-name) %>% 
  mutate(prop_female=female/(female+male)) %>% 
  gather(gender,count,-year)

gg<-madison_count %>% filter(gender=="prop_female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,count))+geom_line()+ylim(c(0,1))+ labs(title='Fraction of "Madison"s Given to Female Newborns')
gg
```
It completely flipped to being a girls name in 1985.  A close look shows that there weren't many boys named Madison before 1985 and the overall popularity of the name spiked in 1985.
```{r}
gg<-madison_count %>% filter(gender!="prop_female") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,count,fill=gender))+geom_col()
gg
```
There is one reason, the movie "Splash," which was released in 1984.

You can learn more about the cool `gender` package [here](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/gender_tutorial/).

#Now back to our rock musician problem.
But I digress. First we have to separate the musician name into pieces.  BUT, where there are three or more words in the name, which is the first name?  Joe Harmonica Watson and Wild Bill Williams both have nicknames but different positions for the first name.

This is what I chose:

1. Separate name into, at most, 3 parts, starting from the left side.  This will create most of the first names in the `middle` column and a much smaller number of names in the `first` column.

2. Scan both columns to assign a gender for each column entry. This will create columns `gender.x` and `gender.y`. Most of the `gender.x` entries will be `NA`.

3. Use the gender assigned to `middle`.  If it is `NA` see if we have a gender for `first` and use that.

4. Set any remaining `NA`s to "Undetermined."


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
load("deaths.rdata")
deaths<-deaths %>% separate(Name,into=c("First","Middle","Last"),fill="left",extra="merge",remove=FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(birth=as.integer(year(Date)-Age)) %>% filter(birth>1880,birth<2012)

pass1<-deaths %>% gender_df(name_col = "First",year_col = "birth")
pass2<-deaths %>% gender_df(name_col = "Middle",year_col = "birth")
sex<-bind_rows(pass1,pass2) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  transmute(First=name,gender=gender,birth=year_min)

#assign gender based on first name first, then middle
deaths<-deaths %>% left_join(sex) %>% 
  select(-First) %>% 
  rename(First=Middle) %>% 
  left_join(sex,by=c("First","birth")) %>% 
  mutate(gender=ifelse(!is.na(gender.x),gender.x,gender.y)) %>%
  mutate(gender=ifelse(!is.na(gender),gender,"undetermined")) %>%
  select(-First,-Last,-gender.y,-gender.x) %>% 
  {.}


prop.table(table(deaths$gender))
```
So only 10% of the entries are assumed to be female.  This precludes running the same detailed analysis we did earlier by gender.  Just so it isn't a wasted trip let's look at the aggregate proportions of general causes.

The code below shows an efficient way to do a 1-way proportional crosstab using `dplyr`.

```{r}
deaths <- deaths %>% filter(gender != "undetermined")
xt<- deaths %>% count(General_Cause,gender) %>% 
  spread(gender,n,fill=0) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric,funs(./sum(.))) %>% 
  arrange(male)

#now that the causes are arranged in order of male mortality, change causes to a
#factor ordered the same way.
xt$General_Cause<-as_factor(xt$General_Cause)

xt
```

We need to visualize this in a chart form. For fun, let's show some bad, but typical, versions.  The chart below is the kind of thing I often see in presentations in my organization.
```{r}
xt %>% gather(gender,proportion,-General_Cause) %>% ggplot(aes(General_Cause,proportion,fill=gender))+geom_col(position = "dodge")+coord_flip()
```
Yes, you can tease out comparisons but the differences are only apparent upon very close scrutiny.  

It could be worse. The categories could be in alphabetical order.  There are LOTS of [questions and answers on this topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3253641/change-the-order-of-a-discrete-x-scale) on Github.com.  For my money, `as_factor` from the `forcats` package (loaded as part of the `tidyverse`) is the simplest way to address this, as shown above.

An even less legible version is below.  Very pretty artwork, though.  Yes, I see charts like this sometimes. Sometimes from paid consultants!
```{r}
xt %>% gather(gender,proportion,-General_Cause) %>% ggplot(aes(gender,proportion,fill=General_Cause))+geom_col(position="dodge")
```
Ugh! These candy jars are unusable.  I include them because I see this sort of plot all the time. People don't naturally gravitate to the far more useful scatter plot.  It should be the go-to visualization when comparing two populations of categorical variables.
```{r}
gg<-xt %>% ggplot(aes(male,female))+geom_point()
gg<-gg+  geom_text_repel(label=xt$General_Cause)
gg<-gg+geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0)
#gg<-gg+labs(title="Rock Stars are (Almost) Like the Rest of US\nProportion of all 
#Deaths",caption="Sources: Wikipedia and CDC",
#y='Rock Music Deaths (1950-Present)',x='US Deaths (2015)')
#gg<-gg+scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)
#gg<-gg+scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)
gg


```
People are so ingrained to seeing categorical variables or time series on the horizontal axis that scatter plots throw them off for a second.  But it doesn't throw you, dear reader, I am sure.  We know that points above the line mean that females are proportionately more like to die of that cause and vice-versa.  Outliers are immediately visible.

This chart shows that males were more likely to die of heart disease than females and, for drugs, less. Beyond that there were no significant differnces.  Again, the scatter plot brings this very clearly to light.

#Where did they die?

```{r}
deaths_loc<-deaths %>% 
  separate(Location,c("neighborhood","city","state","country"),
           remove=FALSE,
           sep=", ",
           fill="left",
           extra="merge") %>% 
  select(Name,Date,city,state,country)

deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(country=ifelse(country=="","Not Specified",country))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=ifelse(is.na(city),"Not Specified",city))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(country=ifelse(country=="U.S.","USA",country))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(country=ifelse(country=="U.K.","England",country))
deaths_loc %>% group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
```

This doesn't reveal any surprises.  Again, it says something about the home of rock and the location of people who submit entries to Wikipedia.  We could go further and compare these numbers to population but we wouldn't learn anything not already obvious.

What about cities?

```{r}
deaths_city<-deaths_loc %>% group_by(city) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
deaths_city
```
Again, not a surprise.  It's a bit surprising to me that London is not on the list. On second thought, every English rock star I can think of moved to the U.S.  I occasionally walk by the flowers outside David Bowie's house in Manhattan.

When I first started looking a using maps and census data in R the tidyverse was less established.  Over the last two years a few packages have emerged that have made working in these realms much easier.  Specifically, `tidycensus` and `sf`, the "simple features"" package.  This project gives us a chance to check them out.

Let's look at the city list on a per capita basis using tidycensus data.  Do L.A., Nashville and Memphis have more rock musicians than population would suggest?

I got inspired to look at this while reading about the`tidycensus` package.  Try as I might, though, I could not get the national city-level population data.  I concluded that the functionality of this package is too limited, for now.  I reverted to the excellent `censusapi` package (which the author of `tidycensus` suggested).  This still took a lot of trial and error before I could craft a query that returned what I needed.  Key breakthrough: "place" means "city."

Grab the data from [census.gov](https:census.gov).  Visually inspecting the city names in both data sets gives is some ideas about how to clean up both data sets.

```{r}
library(censusapi)
#I've stored my API key as an environment variable
#with sys.setenv(CENSUS_KEY="<my key")
city_pop_raw<-as_data_frame(getCensus(name="acs3",
                                  vintage=2012,
                                  vars=c("NAME","B01001_001E"),
                                  region="place"))

#remove numeric IDs, rename column and strip place signifier
city_pop<-city_pop_raw %>% 
  select(-state,-place) %>% 
  separate(NAME,into=c("city","state"),sep=",") %>% 
  rename(population=B01001_001E) %>% 
  mutate(city=str_replace(city,
                          "([A-Za-z -]+) city|town|municipality|CDP|village|borough",
                          "\\1")) %>%
  mutate(city=str_trim(city),state=str_trim(state))

#do some clean up to help the city names in both data sets line up.
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"New York City","New York"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Brooklyn","New York"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Queens","New York"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Bronx","New York"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Burbank","Los Angeles"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Anaheim","Los Angeles"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Sherman Oaks","Los Angeles"))
deaths_loc<-deaths_loc %>% mutate(city=str_replace(city,"Oakland","San Franciso"))

#take just first part of hyphenated cities
city_pop<- city_pop %>%   mutate(city=str_replace(city,"([A-Za-z ]+)-(.)+","\\1"))
```

Now we have a clean list of cities and populations.  Let's merge it with our death locations to get a per-capita number.  We arbitrarily limit our cities to those with populations greater than 200k to avoid skewed results.  Now we can see what cities have the highest number of musician deaths relative to population.
```{r}

deaths_city<- deaths_loc%>% group_by(city) %>% 
  filter(country=="USA",city != "Not Specified") %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))%>% 
  left_join(city_pop) %>% 
  filter(population>200000) %>% 
  mutate(per100k=count*100000/population) %>% 
  arrange(desc(per100k))
deaths_city
```
This does give us some idea of where musicians congregate.  The only big surprise is how low New York city is on the list.  The music scene is obviously nationally significant.  It's just that the city is sooo big. It may also be that musicians don't die in New York. They move to L.A. if they succeed in the business or back to their hometowns when they leave the business.  This is just speculation on my part.

Finally let's do a city map showing the counts.
```{r}
library(ggmap)
library(tigris)


#get pretty map image
map_g <- get_map(location='United States', zoom=4, color="bw")

#a source of lat/lon data for US cities.  There are many.  I was frustrated with geocode functions becuase of api limits or bad data.
geo_data<-read_csv("http://notebook.gaslampmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/zip_codes_states.csv")

#make a table toconvert postal state appreviations to long names,
state.convert<-data_frame(st=state.abb,state=state.name)
#geo data uses state abbreviations but our data uses full names.  Fix. Use just
#one location per city
city_loc<-geo_data %>% rename(st=state) %>% 
  left_join(state.convert) %>%
  transmute(city=city,st=st,state=state,lat=latitude,lon=longitude) %>% 
  group_by(city,state) %>% 
  top_n(1,lat)%>% 
  top_n(1,lon) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  mutate(state=ifelse(st=="PR","Puerto Rico",state)) %>% 
  {.}

deaths_city<-left_join(deaths_city,city_loc)
# plot
gg<-ggmap(map_g, legend='bottomright', extent='panel') +
  geom_point(data=filter(deaths_city,count>4),
            aes(x=lon, y=lat,
                color=per100k, 
                size=count
                ),alpha=0.7,
            na.rm=T) +
  scale_colour_gradient(low="white", high="red") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2,12))

gg<-gg+theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
             axis.ticks = element_blank(),
             axis.title = element_blank())

gg<-gg+labs(title="Where Do Rock Musicians Die?",
            subtitle="Circle size is count. Circle color is count relative to population.")
gg
```
