## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(xts)
library(knitr)
library(remotes)
library(gt)

remotes::install_github("https://github.com/rstudio/gt.git")
load(file='playlists.rdata')
claylists <- playlists %>% filter(DJ=="WA") %>% mutate(artist_song = paste(ArtistToken,Title,sep=" - "))

write_csv(claylists,"claylists.csv")
claylists <- ungroup(claylists)
claylists <- claylists %>% 
#  mutate(year_month=ceiling_date(AirDate,unit="months")-1) %>% 
  mutate(year_month=as.yearmon(AirDate)) %>% 
  group_by(year_month,ArtistToken,artist_song) 

claylists %>% group_by(year_month,artist_song) %>% 
  summarise(top_songs=n()) %>% 
  arrange(year_month,desc(top_songs)) %>% top_n(10) %>% 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
